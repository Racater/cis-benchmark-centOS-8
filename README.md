## Note:
 Hi all, this is my first time creating a project on GITHUB. Since, this is my first time doing such project, I would like to ask you guys to help me check it out. Feel free to send feedback on what to improve on or add any new features.
 
 Do note that the script will take a while to complete due to the execution of function 'no_exist' as it has to go through multiple checks, thus compared to other function, 'no_exist' function takes quite a while to complete. 
 
## UPDATES:
 I will be adding new features to the script such as displaying the json data and adding options to the script. So stay tune :)
